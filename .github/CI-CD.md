# CI/CD Guide

How automated checks and deployment work for this project.

**Contributing?** You only need the [CI](#ci-what-runs-on-your-pr) section —
it explains what runs on your pull request and how to reproduce any failure
locally. The deployment section is for maintainers with production access.

---

## CI (what runs on your PR)

Every pull request runs [`ci.yml`](workflows/ci.yml). Six jobs run in parallel,
so you get all the failures at once instead of one at a time.

| Job | What it checks |
|---|---|
| **Lint & type-check** | ESLint and TypeScript across every workspace, then a full build |
| **Prisma schema** | Migrations apply cleanly to a fresh database, and `schema.prisma` matches them |
| **Python checks** | The GenAI service compiles, and `ruff` passes |
| **Build images** | All four Dockerfiles still build |
| **Validate compose** | Both `docker-compose` files are well-formed |
| **Secret scan** | No credentials committed anywhere in history |

### Reproducing a failure locally

Run the same commands CI does, from the repo root:

```bash
# Lint & type-check
pnpm run lint
pnpm run check-types
pnpm run build

# Python checks (needs apps/genAI/.venv, see below)
cd apps/genAI
python -m compileall -q app
pip install ruff && ruff check app

# Docker build (one service)
docker build -f apps/frontend/Dockerfile.prod .

# Compose validation
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml config --quiet
```

For Prisma, CI applies migrations to a throwaway database. To do the same
against your local one:

```bash
cd packages/db
pnpm exec prisma validate
pnpm exec prisma migrate deploy
```

If you changed `schema.prisma`, you must also commit a migration. CI fails
otherwise:

```bash
cd packages/db
pnpm exec prisma migrate dev --name describe_your_change
```

### Working on the GenAI service

The Python service is not covered by `pnpm install`. Set it up once:

```bash
cd apps/genAI
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env      # then add your own API keys
```

It needs free API keys from [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys),
[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey), and
[Tavily](https://tavily.com). Without them the service still starts and
`/health` works — only the AI endpoints return an error telling you which key
is missing.

### Things to know

-**ESLint currently reports pre-existing errors** in the frontend. That step
  is set to report without blocking, so it will not fail your PR. Please do not
  add new ones — and a PR that cleans them up is welcome.
-**Ruff is enforced** for Python. Most issues auto-fix with
  `ruff check app --fix`.
-**Docker builds are cached**, but a cold run takes a while. The GenAI image
  is the slowest because of its ML dependencies.

## Deployment (maintainers)

>This section needs Docker Hub and production server access. Contributors can
>skip it — deploys happen automatically after a PR is merged.

Pushing to `main` triggers [`cd.yml`](workflows/cd.yml), which builds and
pushes four images to Docker Hub, scans them with Trivy, then deploys over SSH.

### Required secrets

Configured under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**.

Repository secrets:

| Secret | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` | Docker Hub account owning the images |
| `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` | Docker Hub access token, not a password |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Build arg so `prisma generate` can run during the image build |

Environment secrets, on an environment named `production`:

| Secret | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SSH_HOST` | Server hostname or IP |
| `SSH_USER` | User permitted to run `docker` |
| `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | Private key, full PEM including BEGIN/END lines |
| `SSH_PORT` | Optional, defaults to `22` |
| `DEPLOY_PATH` | Absolute path to the repo checkout on the server |

Keeping deploy credentials on the environment rather than the repository limits
them to the `deploy` job, and lets you require a reviewer before anything
reaches production (**Environments → production → Required reviewers**).

### Server prerequisites

The pipeline does not bootstrap the server. Before the first deploy:

1. Docker and the Compose plugin installed.
2. Repository cloned at `DEPLOY_PATH`.
3. `.env.prod` present there with production values: `POSTGRES_USER`,
   `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB`, `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`,
   `JWT_SECRET`, `FRONTEND_URL`, the GenAI keys, and `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.
4. The public key matching `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

`.env.prod` is never committed and never written by the pipeline. It lives only
on the server.

### Image tags and rollback

Every build publishes `:latest` and `:<commit-sha>`. The deploy pins the SHA, so
the running version is always unambiguous — and rolling back is one command:

```bash
cd <DEPLOY_PATH>
IMAGE_TAG=<last-good-sha> docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### Database migrations

Migrations are **not** run by the deploy job. The `backend` service applies them
itself on startup, via its compose command. CI proves on every PR that the
migration history still applies to a clean database, so a broken migration is
caught before it reaches the server.

### Known gaps

-Trivy scanning is report-only; findings appear in logs but do not block a
  deploy.
-No staging environment — `main` goes straight to production.
-`docker compose up -d` recreates changed containers, so deploys have brief
  downtime. There is no rolling update.
